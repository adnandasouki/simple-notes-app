## Class
1. the @override annotation only works if the method exists in the parent class.
2. The file name and class name can be different, though it’s a good practice to keep them similar for readability.

## Methods
For a StatelessWidget Class
1. build(BuildContext context) → defines the UI.

For a StatefulWidget Class
1. initState() → called once when the widget is inserted in the widget tree.
2. dispose() → called when the widget is removed.
3. didChangeDependencies() → called when inherited widgets change.
4. didUpdateWidget(covariant OldWidget oldWidget) → called when the widget configuration changes.
5. build(BuildContext context) → defines the UI.

## Navigation
1. you can define multiple classes/widgets in the same file, but when navigating (e.g., with Navigator.push), you instantiate and navigate to a specific widget only.

Unsorted notes
1. Not having BuildContext context doesn’t prevent building; it only prevents the widget from accessing inherited widgets, theme data, or other context-dependent information.
2. setState() only triggers the build() method of that specific widget’s State class.
